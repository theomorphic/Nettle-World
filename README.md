So I've tried to use **Swup** and it wasn't efficient enough. The content is loading like it used to be. You need to wait about 3-5 secs before the clicking. It's like not having the feature at all. I thought maybe it's because of huge png so I changed that to svg but that was worse. First of all, svg was wrong. I changed  b **xlink:href="data:img/png;** to **xlink:href="data:image/png;** just to see the images. But it doesn't solve the problem with loading. So okay, I've tried my best.
